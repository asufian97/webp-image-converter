# WebP Image Converter

This project is a simple **web-based tool** built with Flask to convert images (JPEG/PNG) to WebP format. It also supports converting to PNG and JPEG. Users can upload a single image or multiple images for conversion, and multiple images will be provided as a ZIP file for convenience.

## Features

- **Convert Single or Multiple Images**: Convert JPEG/PNG images to WebP, PNG, or JPEG format.
- **Flexible Output Options**: Users can adjust image dimensions (width and height) and quality.
- **Dynamic Download**: Single images are downloaded directly, while multiple images are packaged into a ZIP file.
- **Preview Uploaded Images**: Users can preview selected images before conversion.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Dependencies**: Flask, Pillow (for image processing)

Create a Virtual Environment: It is recommended to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the Requirements: Install the necessary packages using requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Flask application:

Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Web App: Open your browser and go to:
